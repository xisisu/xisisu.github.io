## RT-Xen

**2025 EMSOFT Test-of-Time Award**

Industry-first real-time multi-core virtual machine schedulers for the Xen hypervisor. The RTDS scheduler has been [officially adopted into Xen mainline since Xen 4.5](https://github.com/xen-project/xen/blob/master/xen/common/sched/rt.c).

**Key contributions:**
- Real-time VCPU scheduling in hypervisors using EDF algorithms with multiple server mechanisms
- Multi-core VM scheduling with temporal isolation
- Enables cloud gaming and automotive/aerospace systems
- Production-ready implementation merged into Xen kernel

**Resources:**

## RTCA (Real-Time Communication Architecture)

Improving inter-domain communication efficiency by reducing communication latency between real-time virtual machines when they operate alongside resource-intensive workloads.

## RT-OpenStack

A cloud-based virtual machine scheduling framework enabling mixed workload deployment. Allows organizations to run both real-time and non-real-time virtual machines simultaneously on shared infrastructure through intelligent scheduling mechanisms.
