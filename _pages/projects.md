## RT-Xen

A suite of real-time multi-core virtual machine schedulers for the Xen hypervisor. The RTDS scheduler from this project has been included into the Xen mainstream since Xen 4.5.

**Key contributions:**
- Real-time VCPU scheduling in hypervisors
- Multi-core VM scheduling with temporal isolation
- Production-ready implementation merged into Xen kernel

## RTCA (Real-Time Communication Architecture)

Improving inter-domain communication efficiency by reducing communication latency between real-time virtual machines when they operate alongside resource-intensive workloads.

## RT-OpenStack

A cloud-based virtual machine scheduling framework enabling mixed workload deployment. Allows organizations to run both real-time and non-real-time virtual machines simultaneously on shared infrastructure through intelligent scheduling mechanisms.
